This directory contains logos and icons for ImageJ2.

The microscope depicted is based on a photograph of a Bausch + Lomb
optical microscope from the UW Microscopy Museum collection:

The photograph was taken by Johannes Schindelin and Curtis Rueden,
and reworked into cartoon form by Adam Fraser.

This image is not the final logo for ImageJ2. The plan is to solicit community
submissions for a logo, then vote on the mailing list to decide. The current
logo is a placeholder image being used during the beta phase of development.
